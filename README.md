## About me ðŸ¤™
My name is Giuseppe and I'm a software engineer.

I started working with web stuff in 2004: when I was 14 years old. I still remember the first ugly pages made with Microsoft FrontPage 2003. At the beginning it was just a hobby but I officially turned it in my job since 2012.

### My job ðŸ’»
I'm currently working for [MotorK](https://github.com/motork), in the R&D department as software developer mainly focused on the front end side.

### My hobbies ðŸš€
I like travelling, running, taking pictures, watching tv series and european football (I'm a proud fan of [F.C. Internazionale Milano](https://www.inter.it/en)).
