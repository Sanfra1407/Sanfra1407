## About me

My journey into web development began almost casually back in 2005, when I was just fifteen. One day, while exploring Microsoft Office, I stumbled upon a program called FrontPage 2003. Curious to find out what it was for, I opened it and soon realized it was used to create websites. That moment changed everything.

I started experimenting with it, not knowing a single line of HTML. The process felt similar to PowerPoint — you dropped content, moved things around, and suddenly something appeared on the screen. The first time I saw my own web page come to life, the sense of satisfaction was indescribable. Linking pages together, creating tables, adding images, changing colors — it all felt magical, just like a kid discovering Paint for the first time.

### My job 🧑🏻‍💻

Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience in web development, focused on designing and delivering robust front end architectures.

In the past 9 years I have developed and optimized complex applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, Vue.js and Nuxt.js, contributing to performance improvements, maintainable codebases and consistent design systems.
I also have experience in back end development with PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Lumen, mainly for RESTful APIs and integration with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL

I enjoy building scalable and maintainable web applications using modern and reliable technologies such as:

- TypeScript
- React.js
- Vue.js
- Nuxt.js
- Laravel

### My hobbies 🚀

I like travelling, running, working out, swimming, cooking, watching tv series and european football (proud fan of F.C. Internazionale Milano).
