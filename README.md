## About me 🤙

I'm Giuseppe and I'm a Software Engineer.

I started working with web stuff in 2004: when I was 14 years old. I still remember the first ugly pages made with Microsoft FrontPage 2003. At the beginning it was just a hobby but I officially turned into my job since 2012.

### My job 🧑🏻‍💻

Software Engineer with more than 10 years of professional experience, mainly focused on making front end projects.

In the last 7 years I've developed JavaScript applications using React.js, Vue.js and Alpine.js.

I can also develop back end applications with PHP frameworks like Laravel and Lumen (this one mostly used for writing REST APIs).
During my career I have crafted CRM and CMS with third party APIs integration and MySQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB and SQLite databases engines.

I like creating web applications with the most innovative technologies like:
- React.js
- Vue.js
- TypeScript
- Laravel

### My hobbies 🚀

I like travelling, running, working out, swimming, cooking, watching tv series and european football (proud fan of F.C. Internazionale Milano).
